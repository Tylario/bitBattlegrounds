Drew Huffman & Tyler Hudson

Fortn2te is a battle royale between two players. Top down style, 16 bit styalized game, with guns and building walls. Randomly spawned walls/structures & weapons will be changed each round. A square/circle will close in as the game goes on - each 20 seconds it will close onto a random smaller circle/square.
